## 📦 Installation & Usage

Since these tools are client-side only, you don't need a complex backend to run them.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KaiSingL/toolbox.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd toolbox
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    pnpm install
    ```
    Requires Node.js >=26.

4.  **Run locally:**
    Because the tools use ES modules or strict CORS policies in some browsers, it is best to use a local server.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This serves the site on `http://localhost:8000` and opens it in your browser.

5.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
